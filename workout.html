        I'll make it quick. You probably already know what a workout plan is. If you don't know which one to use, I'll help you with that. So, what workout routine you should you use? That depends on your lifting experience. But you can also workout from home.

            Workout: Beginner
        </ins>
    </h2>
    <h3 class="paragraph">
        A beginner lifter is somebody who has been lifting for less than a year. For that experience you will need to go to the gym 3x a week and each day you work full body. You workout mondays, wednsdays and friday. 
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3 class="paragraph">
        Full body:
        <br>
        Bench press 3x12, 8, 6
        <br>
        Squats 3x12, 8, 6
        <br>
        Deadlifts 3x12, 8, 6
        <br>
        Overhead press 3x12
        <br>
        Barbell/T-Bar Row 3x12
        <br>
        Chin ups 3x12
        <br>
        <br>
        You should not be able to do a single rep after the last one of the set, so you should fail after the last rep. If you don't, increase the weight. The pyramid system(e.g. 3x12, 8, 6) focuses on increasing the weight every set.

    </h1>
    <h3 class="paragraph">
        When you workout from home, your lifting age(the time you have been working out for) doesn't really matter. Only thing that matters is progressive overload. You basically start at some skills and inmprove and advance them.
        So, for example, you start at knee pushups and you want to do pushups. You get to pushups and now you want to do a one arm pushup. You get there and improve. This system can be used for every skill. I'm no expert in calisthenics(bodyweight exercises) but I did them once and I have some experience in them. So, just search calisthenics exercises(there are a lot) and try to do them and achieve them.

    <h2 class="title">
        Now, this is all you really need to know about working out to get an aesthetic body. One more thing: The "aesthetic" muscle groups are neck, traps, upper chest, side delts, lats and abs. Build those muscles and get lean and you'll attract many girls. I hope this helped.

        Now, here is all you need to know about dieting:
    </h2>
    <h3 class="paragraph">
        A diet or meal plan doesn't necessarly have to be for weight loss. It can be for anything. But remember, you can't outwork you diet. You can run till your face is blue, but with a shit diet you aren't gonna lose weight. However, a diet can be very boring if you're eating the same things every day. So, you have 1 out of 2 options.
        1, you can make 3-6 meals and eat them every day, or 2, you can make 21 meals for a week and eat 3 of them every day. You also need to track your calories and macros so you can know how much left you got to eat. You need to eat sufficient carbs, <ins>protein</ins>, and fats. Here are some foods you can use to do that:
        <ul>
            <li>Meat in general</li>
            <li>rice</li>
            <li>Sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>Healthy fats(avocadoes, olive oil, ...</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        With this information you can build your own meal plan. Now it's less information than in the workout webpage, but it's really not that much information needed, just discipline. The max. times you can eat a cheat meal is once a month.

            Bulking
        </ins>
    </h2>
    <h3 class="paragraph">
        When you bulk, you try to get above 15% bodyfat in order for you to be able to build muscle. The avarage male cannot gain any more muscle when his bodyfat is at a certain point or lower. For most men this point is 15%-12% bf. So you need to go into a calorie surplus, so that you can gain a little weight but be able to build muscle.

            Cutting
        </ins>
    </h2>
    <h3 class="paragraph">
        Cutting is when you try to lose weight so that your muscles are more conditioned. The con of cutting is that you eat less food and you automatically eat less protein, so it's hard to impossible to gain muscle. What I recommend doing is going on a bulk-cut cycle, so basically bulking for a certain amount of months and then cutting down to 
        12% bf for a month or two, and then again cutting. This will make you look better over time. Note that you first need to calculate your maintanance calories and then add or take away 300-500kcal depending on weather you are cutting or bulking.

    </h2>
    <h3 class="paragraph">
        Protein shakes and suplements will help you reach your goal easier, naturally. Neither creatine nor preworkout is a steroid. And a protein shake also counts as a meal, so you must have at least 4 meals a day, no matter if you're cutting or bulking.
